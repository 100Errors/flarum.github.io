      We're really excited to get Flarum into your hands! However, for the sake of both our sanities, let's make a few things clear.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>This is beta software.</strong> It has bugs and will probably break. (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/contributing">Help us make it better!</a>)</li>
      <li>Upgrading from beta to subsequent versions might be a little tricky. We'll do our best to ensure it's as easy as possible.</li>
      <li>The take-home message is that <strong>you should not use this in production</strong>. This beta is solely intended to garner feedback from users and developers.</li>
    </ul>
