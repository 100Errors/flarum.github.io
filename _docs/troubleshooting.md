## Installation

If you're having a problem installing Flarum, check out the [Installation tag](http://discuss.flarum.org/t/installation) on the support forum. Someone might've had the same problem as you! If not, start a discussion and we'll do our best to help.

## Debugging

If you encounter an error while using your forum, the first thing to do is enable debug mode. Simply open up config.php with a text editor, and change the `debug` value to `true`. This will cause Flarum to show detailed error messages, giving you an insight into what's going wrong. *Be sure to turn debug mode off again once the error is fixed!*
