## I have an idea/request for a feature. What should I do?

Before you do anything, we'd be grateful if you could check a few places to see if your idea has already been talked about:

* See the [Features]({{ site.baseurl }}/features) page to see an overview of what's done and what's coming soon.
* See the [Roadmap]({{ site.baseurl }}/roadmap) for an overview of what we are planning to implement.
* Search the [GitHub issues]({{ site.baseurl }}/issues) to see if your idea is planned.
* Search the [forum](http://discuss.flarum.org) to see if your idea has already been discussed.

If you don't find anything, then your next step is to work out whether your feature is actually a good fit for Flarum's core. [Read about the difference]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/extend/) between core, bundled extensions, and third-party extensions. Is this something that the majority of forums will want to use – or is it something that would be better suited to a third-party extension?

If you're positive that it belongs in core, as a bundled extension, or if you're not sure, then [go crazy](https://discuss.flarum.org/t/features)!

<a name="upgrade"></a>

## Will I be able to upgrade from beta to subsequent releases?

Yes! However, the upgrade process may require you to get your hands a little dirty. We'll do our best to ensure it's as easy as possible.

<a name="migration"></a>

## Will I be able to migrate my forum to Flarum?

Yes, but not for a while. Our focus right now is on getting Flarum stable and feature-complete. Once we're confident that Flarum is ready to be used in production, we'll start building tools to import data from other forum software like esoTalk, FluxBB, phpBB, and others.

<a name="stability"></a>

## When will Flarum be stable?

It's impossible for us to say at the moment – there are too many variables! You can follow our progress on the [Roadmap]({{ site.baseurl }}/roadmap).

<a name="formatting"></a>

## How can I format my posts?

Flarum currently does not have a visual editor – it's just something we didn't get to in time for beta. Rest assured, it is planned and will be available in the core soon.

Despite not having a visual editor at the moment, Flarum does support Markdown and BBCode. Markdown is a plain text format for writing structured documents, based on conventions used for indicating formatting in email and usenet posts. If you are completely new to Markdown, check out [this cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to help you with formatting your posts on Flarum.

<a name="translation"></a>

## How do I translate Flarum into my language?

At this stage there is some preliminary documentation about [Localization]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/extend/localization), but this is intended for developers. If you are not a developer, we kindly ask that you wait until we have properly implemented and documented the language pack creation process. Thanks for your patience!
